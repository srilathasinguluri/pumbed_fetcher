To fetch PubMed data and extract the required fields into a CSV file, you can use Python with the Entrez module from Biopython.

ðŸ“Œ Steps to Implement
Fetch PubMed articles using a query (e.g., "cancer treatment").
Extract relevant details:
PubmedID (PMID)
Title
Publication Date
Non-academic Author(s) (Filtered based on affiliation)
Company Affiliation(s) (Biotech/Pharma companies)
Corresponding Author Email
Save to a CSV file.
ðŸ“Œ Python Script: pubmed_fetcher.py
python



ðŸ“Œ How to Run the Script
Install required packages:

pip install biopython
Run the script:

python pubmed_fetcher.py
The results will be saved in pubmed_results.csv.
ðŸ“Œ Output Format (CSV)
PubmedID	Title	Publication Date	Non-academic Author(s)	Company Affiliation(s)	Corresponding Author Email
12345678	Sample Paper Title	2024-01-01	John Doe	ABC Pharma Inc.	john.doe@example.com
ðŸ“Œ Notes
PubMed does not always provide emails, so the script uses a placeholder (N/A).
If non-academic authors or company affiliations are missing, the column will have N/A.
